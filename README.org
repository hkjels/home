* ~

This repository contains the lion's share of the configuration-files
that I use on my boxes. It's written in a literate style with
[[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]], so it can be read almost like a book.

[[https://hkjels.github.com/home/][Read it?]]

* Get in touch

If you would like to reach out to me about any of this, you can create
an issue or email me: henrik @ kjerringvagãƒ»no

* Up & running

My home relies heavily on Emacs to tangle code-blocks into sourcefiles
that can be installed. Evaluating the line below in your terminal will
install [[https://brew.sh][Homebrew]] and the listed dependencies. The only "dotfiles" that
I keep separate are my editor configurations. I have a set of
configurations for both Vim and Emacs. I no longer use Vim, so their
quite dated, but my Emacs configurations are available for inspiration
at [[https://github.com/hkjels/elan][Elan]].

Brews are libraries and commandline interfaces.
Often brews are bottled, meaning installation is just about
downloading to a location that's on your ~PATH~.
#+begin_src ruby  :tangle Brewfile :noweb yes :comments org
<<brew()>>
#+end_src

Casks are executables that can not be found in the Appstore.
There are also some resources like fonts available as Casks.
#+begin_src ruby  :tangle Brewfile :noweb yes :comments org
<<cask()>>
#+end_src

With using ~Mas~ we can download applications from the Appstore directly
from the commandline.
#+begin_src ruby  :tangle Brewfile :noweb yes :comments org
<<mas()>>
#+end_src
