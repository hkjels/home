* ~

This repository contains the lion's share of the configuration-files
that I use on my boxes. It's written in a literate style using
[[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]], so it can be read almost like a book.

If you would like to reach out to me about any of this, you can create

* Up & running

My home relies heavily on Emacs to tangle code-blocks into sourcefiles
that can be installed. Evaluating the line below in your terminal will
install [[https://brew.sh][Homebrew]] and the listed dependencies. The only "dotfiles" that
I keep separate are my editor configurations. I have a set of
configurations for both Vim and Emacs. I no longer use Vim, so their
quite dated, but my Emacs configurations are available for inspiration
at [[https://github.com/hkjels/elan][Elan]].
