Welcome to my humble home. I like to keep it tidy just in case
someone extraordinary; such as yourself, come to visit.

* Up & running

My home relies heavily on Emacs to tangle code-blocks into sourcefiles
that can be installed. Evaluating the lines below in your terminal
will install [[https://brew.sh][Homebrew]] and [[https://emacs.org][Emacs]]. Once those are installed, it will
issue Emacs to do the rest.

#+begin_src shell
make install
#+end_src
