*** X

In order for debian to know how X should be initialized, we need a
runcom for it. Here, I've hardcoded a path for wallpapers and set [[https://dwm.suckless.org][dwm]]
as my window-manager.
#+begin_src shell :tangle (linux "~/.xinitrc")
if [ -d /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d ]; then
  for f in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/*; do
    [ -x "$f" ] && . "$f"
  done
  unset f
fi

feh --bg-fill $HOME/pictures/wallpaper
setxkbmap -option caps:escape

exec dwm
#+end_src

*** SDDM


  
*** DWM

DWM stands for Dynamic Window Manager. It's a window-manger written in
C with a very deliberate and easy to understand layout. Last window
spawn, opens as a master window to the left and secondary windows end
up as a stack to the right. The configuration itself is written in C
and compiled with the manager, so the performance is near what your
metal can achieve.
